This basic script is intended as a reference tool to calculate daily calorie intake for general needs and running purposes.

It begins by calculating the **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** for both females and males using the Harris-Benedict formula.
Next, it estimates Non-Exercise **Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)** by multiplying the BMR by a coefficient based on the average number of steps per day.
The script then calculates the additional calorie requirements for running activities, both on flat terrain and with elevation changes.

As a bonus, it also breaks down the total calorie intake into recommended grams of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to meet nutritional goals.
